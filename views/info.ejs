<h1 style="color: rgb(20, 58, 163); font-size: 30px;">What makes a Perfect Match??</h1>
<p style="font-size: 23px;font-family: 'Segoe UI';margin-top: 0.5cm;">What makes a perfect match 
HLA characteristics are the most important factor in finding a matching donor. In order for a stem cell transplant to have the highest chance of success, ideally 10 out of 10 relevant HLA characteristics should match between the patient and the donor. If a patient is lucky enough to have several matches, other factors will be analysed to find the best match. This is why we test more than 10 HLA characteristics. 
As part of the initial typing, we also tissue type for further parameters that could prove advantageous, either now or in the future, such as the entire KIR receptor family, MICA/B, CCRS, HLA-DPB1, HLA-E, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DRB3/4/5 and the ABO and Rh blood groups. In addition, our donors are also tested for cytomegalovirus (CMV), a common herpes virus.
